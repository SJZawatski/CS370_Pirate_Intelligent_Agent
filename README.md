## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project features my intelligent pirate agent built using reinforcement learning. The goal was to train an AI agent to locate treasure efficiently in a simulated pirate environment while avoiding obstacles and competition from other pirates.  

The provided starter code included the environment setup, basic movement logic, and data structures for rewards and penalties. I implemented the learning algorithm that allowed the agent to analyze feedback from its actions and improve over time. My code handled the reward updates, Q-learning logic, exploration-exploitation balance, and overall decision-making process.  

This notebook demonstrates my ability to apply reinforcement learning and neural network concepts to a real-world problem and to fine-tune model parameters to optimize agent behavior.

### What code was I given, and what did I create?
I was provided with the environment structure and basic helper functions for the pirate simulation. I wrote the main reinforcement learning logic, including the agentâ€™s decision-making loop, reward tracking, and performance analysis. I also customized the parameters to help the pirate learn faster and perform more efficiently.

### Connecting learning to computer science
Computer scientists design systems that solve complex problems through logic, data, and experimentation. This project showed how reinforcement learning can be applied to adaptive decision-making in gaming, robotics, and automation. It reflects the core of computer scienceâ€”problem-solving through algorithms and innovation.

### How I approach a problem as a computer scientist
My process starts by analyzing the problem, understanding the requirements, and breaking it into smaller, testable parts. I then design algorithms, test them iteratively, and refine them based on results. For this project, that meant repeatedly running simulations, reviewing output patterns, and tweaking hyperparameters until the agent performed consistently well.

### My ethical responsibilities
Ethical responsibility in AI involves ensuring fairness, transparency, and safety. As a computer scientist, I must design systems that protect users and data while avoiding harm. With this pr
